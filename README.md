##Objective

The primary goal of our research is to build a solid deep learning model that accurately recognizes handwritten Vattezhuthu script. This goal fits in with the larger mission to save and expose the rich historical and cultural treasures concealed inside this old script. The core of our effort is handwritten character recognition since it is the key to decoding and comprehending Vattezhuthu manuscripts, inscriptions, and documents.
